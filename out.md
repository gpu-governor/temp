Here's a basic outline for a Raylib course, starting from setting up an empty window to more advanced topics:

### **Lecture 1: Creating an Empty Window**
- **Objective:** Set up a basic Raylib window and understand the main loop.
  - Setting up the development environment
  - Creating the window
  - Main loop: `while` loop for window open and `BeginDrawing` / `EndDrawing`
  - Closing the window

### **Lecture 2: Drawing Basic Shapes**
- **Objective:** Learn to draw and position shapes.
  - Introduction to Raylib shapes: rectangles, circles, lines, and text
  - Positioning shapes with coordinates
  - Adding color to shapes

### **Lecture 3: Handling Input and Interaction**
- **Objective:** Introduce keyboard and mouse input.
  - Capturing keyboard events
  - Mouse interaction: position tracking and clicks
  - Creating simple interactions (e.g., changing color on click)

### **Lecture 4: Working with Images and Textures**
- **Objective:** Load and display images.
  - Loading textures and drawing images on the screen
  - Basic image transformations (scaling, rotation)
  - Unloading resources

### **Lecture 5: Animation Basics**
- **Objective:** Create simple animations.
  - Sprite-based animations
  - Updating positions and creating basic movements
  - Basic physics for smooth movement

### **Lecture 6: Sound and Music**
- **Objective:** Integrate audio into projects.
  - Loading sound effects and music
  - Playing, pausing, and stopping audio
  - Adding audio to interactive elements

### **Lecture 7: Working with Tilemaps and Sprites**
- **Objective:** Load tilemaps and arrange sprites.
  - Loading tilemaps
  - Placing sprites dynamically based on tile data
  - Managing sprite sheets and layering

### **Lecture 8: Basic Game Loop Design**
- **Objective:** Structure a simple game.
  - Designing the game loop for updates and rendering
  - State management: start, play, pause, and end
  - Simple game mechanics (e.g., score tracking)

### **Lecture 9: Collision Detection**
- **Objective:** Introduce collision concepts.
  - Bounding box collisions
  - Handling overlap and separation
  - Adding reactions to collisions

### **Lecture 10: Advanced Topics and Optimization**
- **Objective:** Cover more advanced features.
  - Optimizing game performance
  - Using shaders and advanced rendering techniques
  - Preparing for larger projects
